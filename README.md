# Cookie Stand
An application that has both a main page for pretend customers, and a page that displays individual store data for a mock Salmon Cookie Shop. Site is built with object-oriented programming. Development of the project involved use of object literals, which were then transformed into a constructor function with prototype functions. Project includes an event listener and an event handler for DOM manipulation, as there is a table on the sales.html page that is rendered via JavaScript. 

## User Stories:
### First Round of User Stories:
As a user, I want a webpage that displays individual store data for my Salmon Cookie Shops, so that I can be informed about how to run my business.
As a developer, I want to represent the store data in a list format on the webpage, so my client can view the information.
As a developer, I want to use object-oriented programming to build this site, so that the site will be more effective and the code will be easier to read and understand.
### Second Round of User Stories:
As a developer, I want to implement a constructor function, so that I can reuse code and eliminate much of the duplication in my JavaScript.
As a user, I want cookie sales data represented in tables rather than lists.
